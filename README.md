# Kickstarting with Excel (Module 1)

## Overview of Project - KickStarter Data Analysis for Crowdfunding
	Analyzing Data for Louise, .... in order for her to create a crowdfunding campaign to help her fund her play "Fever".

### Purpose - 
	The budget estimation for the play "Fever" by Louise is $10,000. In order to make the project campaign successful, we need to analyze the data that matches this criteria. Getting a better understanding of how projects related to the same category have been funded in the past. Understanding the key factors responsible for the success of the past projects will greatly help Louise to successfully launch her project. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Deliverable 1 : Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date -
As Louise's play "Fever" has come close to its fundraising goal, we will be analyzing data of different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates.
	As we analyzed the data based on launch dates in the category of theater, we discovered that the projects launched from May to August were likely to be more successful than other months. Projects were more likely to fail towards the end of the year.

### Deliverable 3 : Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals -
Also we wanted to make sure that the estimation made by Louise was appropriate. Hence a comparision in relation to the range of the funding goals is required to get a better picture of how likely it is for Louise campaign to be fully funded. 
 	As a result of this analysis, it was discovered that more that 66% of projects were successfully funded. And out of these 66% projects, 76% projects had goal range of under $4999. 34% of the projects failed due to higher goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered -
1. Ensuring that the data was disturbed throughout the analysis was one of the biggest challenges of performing this analysis on Excel.
   In order to make sure that the data wasn't modified or disturbed, a separate sheet with the original data was created which was used as a checking tool to compare the totals in the goal and pledged columns to ensure that data used was completely acccurate. 

2. Though we are able to derive the % of projects that failed, we still do not have a clear picture about the reason of the failure. The reason of the failure could be either the timing of the launch or the higher goal amount.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	From the above analysis based on launch date, we can conclude that the projects in theater category launched during the earlier part of the year i.e. May to August are more likely to be successful.
	So the launch date should be planned from anytime between May to August.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	From the analysis based on outcomes, its concluded that the project goal should be under $5000 or less in order to be atleast 70% successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The main and biggest limitation of the data set is the actual reason of the failure of the project. There could be various reasons for failure like preferences of people, the time of the project, previous history of the person launching the project. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A graph which gives comparison of the outcomes based on goals as well as pledged can easily display the difference between the two parameters.
